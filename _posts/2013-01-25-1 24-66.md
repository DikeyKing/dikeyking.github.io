    It has been so long that I can’t free myself completely without too many thoughts racking in my brain.

     Again in this city,where I was born,but I spend most time in another city when I am after eighteen.This city always make me nevous.The fouth day here,time is hard to go by for me,I miss the cold air.The meaning of growth,maybe it can be understood this way,although I can spend all day playing games,but every day it slipped away made me upset.I want to make full use of my precious days to make myself stronger.

     The past half year,I didn’t get much time to think about what should I do next,any now,this question remain there.I put myself into the sea of the books,but looking back to recent five years,I know I start it too late,and too many mistakes and wrong choices I’ve made because without a guide to lead me in a right way to go.

     Again in this city,a city go toward a society of civilazation.But there’s no place for my heart to stay.
