I"ø<p>Â  Â  It has been so long that I canâ€™t free myself completely without too many thoughts racking in my brain.</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â Again in this city,where I was born,but I spend most time in another city when I am after eighteen.This city always make me nevous.The fouth day here,time is hard to go by for me,I miss the cold air.The meaning of growth,maybe it can be understood this way,although I can spend all day playing games,but every day itÂ slipped away made me upset.I want to make full use of my precious days to make myself stronger.</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â The past half year,I didnâ€™t get much time to think about what should I do next,any now,this question remain there.I put myself into the sea of the books,but looking back to recent five years,I know I start it too late,and too many mistakes and wrong choices Iâ€™ve made because without a guide to lead me in a right way to go.</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â Again in this city,a city go toward a society of civilazation.But thereâ€™s no place for my heart to stay.</p>
